Hi there! Weâ€™d love your help if you're interested in contributing to Eburyonline. Eburyonline is developed by the [Online team](https://fxsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TEAM/pages/119543461/ONL) members. Check the [VISION](VISION.md) for the project as well as the guidelines below to contribute.

These are the steps to contribute with a new change to this repository:

1. Create an **issue** in JIRA in your project board, complete the required information, add the issue to your current sprint and set the status to the equivalent to "in progress".
2. Create a **branch** in the repository from `master` branch. The name of the branch starts with the JIRA issue identifier and some optional suffix. For example, for issue `ONL-123`, the branch can be named `ONL-123-task`.
3. In every **commit** messages, include a prefix `[ONL-123]` and then a descriptive message. Try to commit frequently and doing commits by atomic changes.
4. When your change is ready to be reviewed, create a [Pull Request](#markdown-header-creating-a-pr) (PR) from the JIRA issue and move your issue to the correct status.
5. Manage the [User Acceptance Testing](#markdown-header-user-acceptance-testing) (UAT) according to the guidelines and update the JIRA issue status.
6. During the [Code Review](#markdown-header-code-review) phase the reviewers could propose changes; and it means possible changes and new commits.
7. When the [Merge conditions](#markdown-header-Merge-conditions) are fulfilled, you can **merge** the code from the PR following the **squash** strategy and **close the issue** in JIRA.

For the development of @ebury/chameleon-components, we use storybook [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## CSS

For chameleon components, we use ITCSS architecture with BEM naming, TailwindCSS for Utilities, and PostCSS as a postprocessor.
Please don't add any CSS styles without following the rules below.

### Vue

The single-file Vue components should not use scoped styles as is not necessary since we follow BEM.

### BEM

A methodology on how to name your classes
http://getbem.com/introduction/

```css
/* Block component */
.btn {}

/* Element that depends upon the block */
.btn__price {}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.btn--orange {}
.btn--big {}
```

### ITCSS

https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/

Following the ITCSS the file CSS structure should look like

1. Settings -
Global CSS variables, e.g. color definitions and maximum widths.

2. Tools -
Mixins, functions etc.

3. Generic -
CSS resets, normalizecss and font-faces. No classes, IDs, or elements.

4. Elements -
Only base HTML elements like p, h1, h2, div etc.

5. Objects -
Layouts and grids.

6. Components -
Classes for specific UI components, most likely you want to add your classes in here.

7. Utilities -
Utility classes generated by TailwindCSS.

### PurgeCSS

All utility classes are automatically purged if they are not used in any `*.vue` or `*.story.js` files. We are following the guide about [controlling the file size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/) when using TailwindCSS.

## Vue app

If you would like to consume and test the behavior of your newly developed components in your local Vue app:

1\. You must create a symlink that will connect the two repos via the npm global folder. On chameleon-components folder run:

```sh
npm link
```

3\. On your Vue app folder run:

```sh
npm link @ebury/chameleon-components
```

4\. All components are exported by name so you can import them with:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@ebury/chameleon-components';
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

To run your tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

The test coverage is set to 100%, but if you think the test for a particular piece of code is not necessary, then mark the code with
`/* istanbul ignore */` flags and get prepared to defend it during the PR. This process gives us visibility that every exclusion has
been approved. For more information see the [istanbul docs](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md)

### Visual regression tests

To run visual regression tests:

```sh
make cypress-integration
```

You can also just run `make cypress-install` and then `make cypress-run` as many times as you want.
It will skip the installation part before each run.

To run tests only for specific story, you can use `storyIdFilter`. The ID of the story can be found in the URL of the storybook, e.g.
"Icon / basic" story has ID `icon--basic`, "Layout / Container / with navigation" has ID `layout-container--with-navigation`.
`storyIdFilter` accepts any regex.

```json
// update in package.json
{
  "test:visual:all": "cypress run -e storyIdFilter=icon ..."
}
```

Visual regression tests run in headless Chrome and Firefox.

NOTE: Because of bugs in Cypress, visual regression tests cannot run All Specs mode. See https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3090 for reference.

NOTE2: Because of another bugs in Cypress, visual regression tests can run only in headless mode. See https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/3324 for reference.

To configure visual regression tests for the story, you can use storybook parameters to do so:

```js
{
  visualRegressionTests: {
    enabled: true, // true by default, if set to false, it will skip the story.
    waitOn: '.search-results', // wait on this element to appear before taking snapshot (cy.get(waitOn)). defaults to #root
    snapshotElement: '.search-results', // take snapshot of this element only. defaults to entire viewport
    knobs: { // you can run the tests using custom knobs, if the story supports them.
      large: { Size: 64 }, // "large" is the name of test, it will be used in the name of the snapshot file. "Size" is the label of the knob, e.g. size: { default: number('Size', 48) }
      'type-error': { Type: 'error' },
    },
  },
}
```

## Linting

To lint and fix errors in files:

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Build

To build your Storybook:

```sh
npm run build-storybook
```

## Submitting changes

These are the steps to contribute with a new change to this repository:

### Creating a PR

A **Pull Request** (PR) is the method of submitting contributions to the project. The project uses Github for PR management and can be created from JIRA issues. The PR is a process for peer review by code maintainers and relevant developers involved in the changes. Considerations during the Pull Request creation:

* The **destination branch** of the Pull Request must be `master` branch.
* The **title** follows the format: [issue-id] type: Title of the issue. (i.e. `[ONL-123] chore: Changing the documentation`) Where the type of the commit follows [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
* Update the **description** to include a descriptive text for changes with notes for the reviewers and screenshots if necessary.
* The default **reviewers** must be the code owners defined in the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file and you must include also some code owners related with third party services, when these changes affects them. Share the PR in [#online-reviews](https://app.slack.com/client/TFMC43PH7/C0132DEVAPM) Slack channel to be reviewed by Online team members.
* Mark the option "close branch after the Pull Request is merged".

### Code Review

**Code Review** is an integral process of software development that helps identify bugs and defects before the testing **phase**. We use the Pull Request (PR) mechanism in Github to do this process. These are the considerations for the code review phase:

* The PR is considered **approved** when **some code owner** have approved the PR.
* The comments can be done at PR level or at detailed level.
* The comments can be in different levels of relevance: **mandatory** or **optional**.
    * The mandatory changes must have a associated **task** in the Pull Request view.
    * All the mandatory changes must be changed and the associated tasks marked as **done**.
* The code owners review the manual checks for **Style guide** of the project.
* If the change is rejected by the code owners and there is not possibility of modifications, the PR will be marked as **declined**, and the process do not continue. If it can be modified, the Pull Request should not be declined, only commented with mandatory changes.
* The code review phase is considered **finished** when all the mandatory changes are done and it is approved.


### User Acceptance Testing

User acceptance testing **User Acceptance Testing** (UAT) is a process to verifying that a solution works for the user. In our process, we will use the [vercel](https://vercel.com) app that we have installed in our repository, on the pull request the app will give as a link with the solution working, once the code review is approved you will need to add this link to the ticket before you pass the ticket to the **DONE** status.

### Merge conditions

Before merging a code in a **Pull Request** to the `master` branch, it is required to comply with **all** the next conditions:

* The **Code Review** phase has **finished**.
* The **Build from circleci** (CI) process marks the PR as **green**.
* There are no **merge conflicts**.
* The branch must be **updated** with the latest commit of `master` branch.
* The strategy that must follow the PR will be **squad**

## Release

When a PR passes all the **Style guide** and is before is merged to the `master` branch, a new version of Chameleon can be released following the next steps

* You must bump the version of chameleon, it can be done with this script `npm version patch`
* Then you should publish the code with the new version in **npm**, use this script to do it `npm publish`, if you are not able to publish because you don't have permission ask one of the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS)
* Last step you need to push the changes to your branch with the follow tags option, script `git push --follow-tags`

## Reporting a problem or requesting a change

If you want to report a problem or request some change you can report an issue to [Eburyonline JIRA project board](https://fxsolutions.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ONL/issues?filter=allissues).

### How to report a bug

Depending on the kind of reporter, and when it is detected bugs will be reported as follows:

* If you are a **contributor or code owner** and detect a bug in this project, you must create a JIRA issue in your board with task type **defect** (see [here](https://fxsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRODUCTS/pages/123095173/Bugs+and+e2e+philosophy)).
    * If it is detected during the Software Development Life Cycle [(SDLC)](https://fxsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRODUCTS/pages/42795535/SDLC), you must create it as subtask of the main task.
    * If it is detected during a release, as subtask of the release task.
    * In other cases, as task.
* **Support team members** will create the JIRA issue as **bug** and communicate with the code owners if the bug comes from production environment (see [here](https://fxsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PRODUCTS/pages/123095173/Bugs+and+e2e+philosophy)).

## Thanks!
