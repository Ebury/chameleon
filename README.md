# Chameleon Components

Chameleon components is Ebury's vue.js components library.
The library is in its initial phase, more components are added regularly.

You can check the current status of the library [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/101NhAtDJ_6YLybdmWnhTvfem9yCtCeHJK5LtCZcX6Rk/edit#gid=0).

Also, check out the latest version deployed in [Storybook](https://chameleon.ebury.now.sh/).

## Installation

Install @ebury/chameleon-components in your project with npm:

```sh
npm install @ebury/chameleon-components --save
```

## Usage

All of our components are exported by name from @ebury/chameleon-components, so you can import them with:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@ebury/chameleon-components';
```

## Contributing

For the development of @ebury/chameleon-components, we use storybook [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
If you want to contribute to the library then you must do the following to set up your local environment:

### Storybook

1\. Clone chameleon-components repo

2\. Install all dependencies with:

```sh
npm install
```

3\. Run Storybook with:

```sh
npm start
```

That's it!
By now you should be up and running. You can check the existing components or create new ones.

### CSS

For chameleon components, we use ITCSS architecture with BEM naming, TailwindCSS for Utilities, SASS as a preprocessor (deprecated - will be removed in the future) and PostCSS as a postprocessor.
Please don't add any CSS styles without following the rules below.

#### Vue

The single-file Vue components should not use scoped files as is not necessary since we follow BEM.

#### BEM

A methodology on how to name your classes
http://getbem.com/introduction/

```css
/* Block component */
.btn {}

/* Element that depends upon the block */
.btn__price {}

/* Modifier that changes the style of the block */
.btn--orange {}
.btn--big {}
```

#### ITCSS

https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/

Following the ITCSS the file CSS structure should look like

1. Settings -
Global CSS variables, e.g. color definitions and maximum widths.

2. Tools -
Mixins, functions etc.

3. Generic -
CSS resets, normalizecss and font-faces. No classes, IDs, or elements.

4. Elements -
Only base HTML elements like p, h1, h2, div etc.

5. Objects -
Layouts and grids.

6. Components -
Classes for specific UI components, most likely you want to add your classes in here.

7. Utilities -
Utility classes generated by TailwindCSS.

#### PurgeCSS

All utility classes are automatically purged if they are not used in any `*.vue` or `*.story.js` files. We are following the guide about [controlling the file size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size/) when using TailwindCSS.

### Vue app

If you would like to consume and test the behavior of your newly developed components in your local Vue app:

1\. You must create a symlink that will connect the two repos via the npm global folder. On chameleon-components folder run:

```sh
npm link
```

3\. On your Vue app folder run:

```sh
npm link @ebury/chameleon-components
```

4\. All components are exported by name so you can import them with:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@ebury/chameleon-components';
```

### Testing

To run your tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

The test coverage is set to 100%, but if you think the test for a particular piece of code is not necessary, then mark the code with
`/* istanbul ignore */` flags and get prepared to defend it during the PR. This process gives us visibility that every exclusion has
been approved. For more information see the [istanbul docs](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md)

### Linting

To lint and fix errors in files:

```sh
npm run lint
```

### Build

To build your Storybook:

```sh
npm run build-storybook
```

To build your app (Vue CLI):

```sh
npm run build
```
