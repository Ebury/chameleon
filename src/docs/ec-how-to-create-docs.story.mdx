# How to create a doc page

## For a component

__In order to create a doc page for a component you will need to have__:

* The component itself
* The stories that you will need to create the doc page

## **Steps**

### Create the doc file (`mdx`)

You will need to go to the folder of the component that you want create the doc page and create a file with the same name of the folder
and add '.story.mdx'


### Start writing the doc

You can start importing and using the meta markdown
```
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

<Meta title="component" />
```
This will define the title of the page and needs to be different than other pages of the docs.

### Using stories on the doc

In order to use the stories already created on the doc page you will need to import the `Story` block and use it like that:
```
import { Story } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

import EcTimer from './ec-timer';

<Story name="basic">
  <EcTimer />
</Story>
```

  - The `name` attribute on the `Story` block is the name of the story, you can find it on the file `story.js`.
  - You will need to import the component that is use on the story in order see the story.
  - Is not needed to pass any attribute to the component, it will get the attributes from the `story.js` file.

### Adding the ArgsTable

You can add a table with all the args that the component will have or even a story.

```
import { ArgsTable } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

import EcTimer from './ec-timer';

<ArgsTable story="basic" />
<ArgsTable of={EcTimer} />
```

There are examples of how to do it.

## Without any component

In order to create a new doc page you will need to follow this steps.

## Steps

### Create a doc file

You must create a new file on the `src/docs` folder.

It must have the extension `story.mdx` and you can start writting the documentation


### Inside the doc file

You can start importing and using the meta markdown
```
import { Meta } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks';

<Meta title="Docs/How to create docs" />
```
This will define the title of the page and needs to be different of the other pages of docs.
